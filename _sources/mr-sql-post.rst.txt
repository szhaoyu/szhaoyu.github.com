    Map-Reduce framework or algrithm is good for indexing scraped web pages or proccessing server logs.

    It's proccess requirement is simple, but data scale is large.

    But for complex structured data proccessing, hadoop's map-reduce is little inefficent.

    Hadoop's working context is Input file and out file. RDBMS's context is more than that, it used more memory to compute.

    Here compare the function of Map-Reduce to SQL

    Map function equals to SQL's 'where' predictor.

    Reduce function equals to SQL's 'group by' operator.

    And SQL has much more function semantics than hadoop's single Map-Reduce algrithm.
